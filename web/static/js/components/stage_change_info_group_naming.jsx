    The skinny on Group Naming:
    <div className="ui basic segment">
      <ul className="ui list">
        <li>
          Help the facilitator arrive at a sensible name/label for each group of ideas
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't feel that you need to name groups that contain a single idea.
          (Their name is implicit!)
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't feel that you need to get the name perfect!
          Perfectionism has diminishing returns in this stage.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </React.Fragment>
